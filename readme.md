# [My Portfolio Website](https://www.danielstrong.tech)

### About

My custom portfolio site made to show my work and blog posts. Feel free to contact me, if you have any questions.

### Main Tech Used

- NextJS
- Forestry CMS
- Styled Components

### Writing Blog Posts

- Posts are written through Forestry CMS
- All uploaded image file names should start with `blog_`
  - We do this so they may be optimized
  - The build will fail otherwise
- Snippets are created with [Carbon](carbon.now.sh)
  - The snippet config can be found in this root directory
  - You can use the auto-width feature to scale correctly
    - BUT image's `width` cannot be larger than `767px`
