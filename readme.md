### About

My custom portfolio site made to show my work and blog posts. Feel free to contact me, if you have any questions.

### Main Tech Used

- NextJS
- Forestry CMS
- Styled Components

### Writing Blog Posts

- Code Snippets - image and text
  - Images
    - There is a snippet template (`code`) to follow in the `.forestry` folder
    - Created with [Carbon](carbon.now.sh) 
      - Config can be found in this root directory 
    - Should start with `blog_`
      - We do this so they will be optimized
      - The build will fail otherwise
    - An image's `width` cannot be larger than `767px`
      - You can use the auto-width feature to scale easily
  - Text
    - Simply paste into into the snippet template mentioned above

- External Images
  - There's a snippet template (`figure`) to follow in the `.forestry` folder
  - Simply fill in the blanks in the template
