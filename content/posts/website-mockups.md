Let's learn how to make some simple website mockups like the one you see above or the others on my [work page](/work "Daniel Strong's Work") for FREE, step by step.

If you search for website mockups or something similar you might find an automated service or different templates to use. I found automated ones when I first searched a while back, but they had the same page shown on each device. Sometimes, I want to showcase different pages or have a modal/menu open, so I ended up creating a step-by-step to achieve this easily in a couple of minutes.

#### Step 1

Go to your site, open the Chrome DevTools, toggle Device Toolbar, and set your width/height using the table below. Check out your site at each size and decide what you want each device image to focus on.

> If you're doing a couple sites, you might want to add the following custom device dimensions to speed yourself up.

| Device | Width | Height | Aspect Ratio |

|:-------:|:-----:|:------:|:------------:|

| Mobile | 375 | 812 | 0.46 |

| Tablet | 768 | 1024 | 0.75 |

| Laptop | 1440 | 900 | 1.60 |

| Desktop | 1920 | 1080 | 1.77 |

#### Step 2

When you're ready click the three dots along the top right, `Run Command` and type/run `Capture Screenshot`. Taking screenshots this way is much better compared to using an extension or another tool I've found.

#### Step 3

Once you've got your screenshots, you need to download the mockup template, which can be found in my [Portfolio GitHub repo](https://github.com/dastrong/Portfolio/blob/master/mockup_template.psd "Portfolio GitHub repo").

#### Step 4

Now go to [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/ "Photopea"), which is a free in-browser graphics editor, and open the template file you just downloaded. 

> I'd suggest installing their PWA to save some space along the top of your screen.

#### Step 5

 In the layers menu (on the right-hand side), open the `paste your designs here` layer.

#### Step 6

Double click the picture-in-picture-looking box to the left of your desired device.

This will open a new tab/file with a `paste here` layer.

#### Step 7

Drop this device's screenshot taken earlier now and stretch it out to fill the whole box. 

You can now save and close that tab.

>  `Ctrl+S` or click `File > Save as Smart Object`

#### Step 8

On your `mockup_template.psd` tab, that screenshot should now be visible.

#### Step 9

Repeat steps 6-8.

#### Step 10

When you're finished `File > Export As > PNG`. Change the file name, width, height, and save.

#### Step 11

Run the file through [TinyPNG](https://www.tinypng.com "TinyPNG") to compress it a bit and download it. 

**Note:** This step isn't necessary at all.

#### Step 12

Voila! Finished. 

As a side note, feel free to move around or remove certain devices if you don't want/need them. All of the mockup images on my portfolio are the same, but yours don't need to be!
