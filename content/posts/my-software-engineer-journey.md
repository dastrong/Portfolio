## Chapter 0 - Ticket Purchase

It's been suggested on more than one occasion that I should write a post about my journey to becoming a developer. It's a good story, albeit an unconventional one, so I hope you find some wisdom in it.

As the title suggests, I don't have a Computer Science degree (I have a BBA), However, it doesn't tell you that I quit my job in 2015 to travel through South East Asia and live in Thailand.  
There I took up teaching to support myself and ended up loving every minute of it. It came with it’s own set of unique challenges, but I found out that I loved teaching and helping others learn.

## Chapter 1 - Check-In

My journey into software development started in August 2017. At this point I had moved from Thailand to South Korea. I was still teaching English, but the summer semester break was just starting.

Flush with free time, I stumbled across [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/ "https://www.udemy.com") and found [Colt Steele's Web Development bootcamp course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/ "https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/"). I love a good deal (I didn't know those 90% off deals on Udemy are never-ending), so I bought it, not expecting that it would leadme to my new career.

## Chapter 2 - Takeoff

I started the course quickly because "there's no time like the present". I can't imagine how much different my life could be without being actionable. If you want something enough, you’ll need to work for it.

> If you want to lose weight, don't wait until next month or January 1st, start making healthy choices 'now'. If you want to get better at running, go out for a run 'now'. If you want to learn something, start 'now'.

## Chapter 3 - Turbulence

I love a good attainable challenge. You'll notice I added 'attainable' there. It wouldn't be smart for me to try to run 50km right now when I haven't run in months.

When I started that course, it was simple; I wanted to complete it before the summer break was over.

There were many times during that course that I grew frustrated, but I persevered. Maybe I just didn't want to go outside when it was 35 degrees and humid (summers in Korea can be brutal), but I learned to change my mindset, think through the problems, and those things that might've frustrated me at first turned into most important learning opportunities.

> I had another motivation too. Other than a good deal, I hate when things go to waste. Whether that be food, clothes, toys, or in this case, a digital course, I can't stand it.

## Chapter 4 - Auto-Pilot

Now finishing that course didn't make me a developer, but it did leave me with a project that thousands of other people doing the course had. I didn't want that, so I started to change the design and add new features.

This is where I started to fall in love with software development. I'd go on vacations with my wife and would dedicate a couple of hours each day to code. Before I knew it, it started to become a habit.

This habit is what allowed me to reach where I am today and ultimately where I want to be in the future.

> I may not learn everything I want to and to be honest the amount of content available to learn is overwhelming. Don't let that get you down.

## Chapter 5 - In-Flight Entertainment

When you're learning by yourself, it can be hard to stay motivated. Unfortunately, I didn't live in Seoul, so an in-person English developer community wasn't available. There are two things, I found that helped me.

The first was, unsurprisingly, joining online developer communities. Here I found other like-minded people to discuss things with and if you're lucky, collaborate on a project or two to get valuable team experience.

The other was building things that when finished I or someone else would want to use. If you're lucky, it might even turn into your very own business! Otherwise, you're left with something that at least you'll use.

> Since I was teaching full-time, I built [a site](https://www.eslintherok.com "https://www.eslintherok.com") that automated a lot of the activities I used in the classroom. Once finished I ended up with an extra hour or two per day that I could put towards adding additional features or learning something else.  

## Chapter 6 - "We need a Doc... Developer"  

When people used to ask me what I did, I would say something along the lines of "I'm an English teacher, but I'm learning to code on the side."  

Once my work started to get used more frequently and I got paid by my first client, my mindset changed. Instead, Istarted to answer with, "I'm a developer” and simply left off the part about teaching

## Chapter 7 - Landing

My metaphorical plane needs to land and I can think of no better content to go here than landing my first full-time development job!

I joined [Codiga](https://www.codiga.io "https://www.codiga.io") in March of this year (2022) and the experience has been nothing short of amazing. [The team](https://www.codiga.io/about-us "https://www.codiga.io/about-us") has been welcoming, the tasks challenging, and our future is bright together.

> Coincidentally, I find myself writing about my journey on the way home from our first meetup in Houston.

## Chapter 8 - Taxi Stand

Soon, I'll be outside waiting.

I already know what my next chapter will include; a shower and some sleep.

I'm not sure exactly what comes after that, but I look forward to waking up before my alarm, opening my computer, seeing my team, and coding the day away.
