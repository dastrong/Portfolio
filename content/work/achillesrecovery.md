This site was created for one of my best friends after he had surgery to repair an achilles tendon tear. He wanted a custom themed blog that didn't look like every other simple blog out there.

Posts are organized by days since his injury to allow readers to follow through his recovery in chronological order or from a certain time frame. I added a Content Management System (CMS) to make it simple for him to create, edit, or delete posts and edit other page content like headings or pictures.
