This personal project came about because I wanted to use Material UI with a Google API and I found myself jumping around trying to watch the previous day's basketball clips and programs each morning.

I ended up creating a responsive YouTube replica that could organize all my targeted videos into playlists without all the other bells and whistles that YouTube offers. Furthermore, I decided to add or improve upon some of the designs as I would be using it daily.

Check out the live site now, and give it a test run. You might find yourself using it more and more!
