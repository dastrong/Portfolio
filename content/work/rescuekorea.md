This was my first project created with a group of other developers during my first Chingu voyage. I was chosen as the Project Manager (PM) and helped lead the team over the six week journey.

Our Rescue Korea site was redesigned and created to help take over the then popular, but poorly built Rescue Korea site. At the conclusion of the voyage, I transferred ownership of the project to my personal GitHub to edit and refactor most of the code into the site that you see today.
