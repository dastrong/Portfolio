There are many forums to share materials for English teachers in South Korea and I found myself continually editing these materials. I realized that throughout Korea there was an inefficiency among teachers repeatedly editing/sharing the same materials, so I set out to create a free resource that all teachers could use to free their time to make other _unique_ lesson material and ultimately make their classes more enjoyable.

Currently, ESL in the ROK offers 19 plug and play ready games that are completely responsive, unique and superior to their PowerPoint counterparts. 

To date, it has over 30,000 rounds played and almost 5,000 hours of active screen time in classrooms.
