My portfolio, the site you are reading this on now, was designed and developed from the ground up by yours truly. 

I've loved the pink/blue/black color scheme since I laid my eyes on those Miami Heat Vice jerseys. I decided to work around those colors to make a light and dark-themed site. I made all of the logos and mockups including the portrait with lighting effects on the home page.

The site is statically built with Next.js to maximize page performance and improve the user experience. I spent a fair amount of time improving the accessibility and SEO to reach a greater audience.
