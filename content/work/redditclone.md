This was created during my second Chingu voyage. I became the Project Manager (PM) for it and led two other new developers over the original six week voyage and even further to complete the project. 

As PM, I attempted to create a true professional environment with daily check-ins, weekly meetings, code reviews and assigned tasks. This helped my team and I gain real world experience whilst creating a polished project.

In addition to my PM duties, I created the entire API and a majority of the client side code to help complete the site.
