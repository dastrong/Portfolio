This was created during my third Chingu voyage. During this voyage, I wanted to focus more on being a developer and handed off management duties to another developer.

Because other team members wanted to focus on client side, I took the task of building the API. For this, I wrote all the code in TypeScript along with tests to be 100% confident in the code.

After completing the API, I jumped over to the client and helped design, refactor and piece together what had been done there.
