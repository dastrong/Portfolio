My name is Daniel Strong and I’m a full-stack JavaScript developer. I was born on Vancouver Island, Canada, but have been living abroad for the past five years.

Currently, I live in South Korea, but I’m looking to transition for the right opportunity to transition full time into web development (wherever that may be).

My stack is any, and everything JavaScript. If your company uses it, perfect! If not, I’m 100% willing and able to learn new languages and/or frameworks. If you think I’d bring value to your company, please message me.

If you’re still not sold, check out some of my past work or read some of my poor written, but hopefully informative blog posts here.
